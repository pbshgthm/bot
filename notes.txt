 Backend (Python) Simplifications

  1. Combined REST API and WebSocket
    - Currently maintains two parallel communication channels with
  duplicate logic
    - Recommendation: Use WebSocket as the primary communication method and
   eliminate the redundant REST API
  2. Simplified Servo Identification
    - Current approach uses multiple dictionaries mapping servo names to
  IDs
    - Recommendation: Use servo IDs directly as the primary identifier and
  remove redundant mappings (self.servo_names, self.servo_ids, etc.)
  3. Optimized Data Structures
    - The code uses self._readers and self._writers caching dictionaries
  with complex key generation
    - Recommendation: Replace with a proper class-based structure or
  simpler lookup mechanism
  4. Reduced Error Handling Complexity
    - WebSocket code has excessive nested try/except blocks and redundant
  error handling
    - Recommendation: Standardize error patterns and use early returns
  instead of deep nesting
  5. Unified Position/Angle Conversion
    - Duplicate conversion logic in _position_to_angle and
  _angle_to_position
    - Recommendation: Use a single direction conversion function with an
  inversion parameter
  6. Simplified Broadcast Logic
    - Complex throttling with last_broadcast_positions and position change
  detection
    - Recommendation: Use a proper event-based model instead of polling for
   changes

  Frontend (TypeScript/React) Simplifications

  1. WebSocket Management
    - Overcomplicated WebSocket connection code with multiple refs tracking
   state
    - Recommendation: Replace with a custom hook that handles connection
  logic
  2. Optimized State Management
    - App component uses too many useRef variables to track state
    - Recommendation: Use useReducer for complex state or extract to custom
   hooks
  3. Simplified Mapping Logic
    - Redundant mappings with both JOINT_TO_SERVO_MAP and
  SERVO_TO_JOINT_MAP
    - Recommendation: Derive one from the other when needed or use a single
   bidirectional map
  4. Improved 3D Controls
    - The URDFDragControls class (885 lines) is overly complex for basic
  joint manipulation
    - Recommendation: Replace with a simpler implementation or use an
  established library
  5. Reduced Code Duplication
    - Multiple implementations of degree/radian conversion throughout the
  codebase
    - Recommendation: Extract common utilities into a shared module

  System-Level Simplifications

  1. Communication Architecture
    - Do we need both API endpoints and WebSockets? No, WebSockets alone
  would be sufficient
    - Recommendation: Use WebSockets exclusively for full-duplex
  communication
  2. Servo Identification
    - Is there a way to use servo IDs directly? Yes
    - Recommendation: Use numeric IDs directly instead of string names
  mapped to IDs
  3. Calibration Storage
    - Current approach stores calibration in a redundant JSON structure
    - Recommendation: Simplify to use servo ID as key with direct values
  (zero/min/max)
  4. Simulation Mode
    - Parallel code paths for simulation vs. hardware mode
    - Recommendation: Use dependency injection pattern to abstract hardware
   access
  5. State Synchronization
    - Complex code to synchronize UI state with hardware state
    - Recommendation: Implement a proper state machine pattern to manage
  synchronization

  These simplifications would reduce code complexity, improve
  maintainability, and make the system more robust while maintaining the
  same functionality.
